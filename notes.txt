1. Turn the standards to use the username as the key and make sure while creating account it was unique
    * signin is page is not showing the excat reason for decline - because of returing the error code directly at func final

2. Captilise and proper casing should be taken care
3. Score updation and proper refresh after update is important
    * Score = weights * 2 + sets * 3 + rep * 0.5
    * we could check the formula based on the user preference as well
    * instead of sending the score from other functions such as update_pr or load_exercise, 
        it better to create a api and use when need

4. The dashboard should rank based on the scores acquired that day.
    
4. Create a generic API to fecth the basic details of the user

5. Go for a bottom nav bar 



4. Exerice names should be checked before, implementation


4. Token expiration should be handled, using a API call to check the expiry of the token if exist
5. Remove the alert functions and use messages with a slight delay

6. Implementaion of Try and catch block over the code
6. A seperate Log alerts only captured somewhere, to analyse later
7. Different setence to be used instead of single words like PR updated, User created
8. Look for the .env file implementation
